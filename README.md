# iter_utils

**iter_utils** is a lightweight but powerful Python library that enhances iterable behavior through:

- Subclassing `list` into a stateful, key-aware structure (`iu_list`)
- Symbolic + structural lambda analysis (`iu_lambda`)
- Bytecode-driven optimizations such as sort-bypass
- Deep iterable utilities (deep max/min, clamped indexing, etc.)

Its core purpose is to offer **flexible, powerful iterator semantics** by combining:
- `list` subclassing  
- runtime lambda deconstruction  
- introspective, state-aware operations on sequences
